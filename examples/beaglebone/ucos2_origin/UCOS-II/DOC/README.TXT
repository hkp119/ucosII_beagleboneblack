***************************** REPORTING PROBLEMS *****************************
******************************************************************************

    If  you find a problem (i.e. bug) in uC/OS-II, do not hesitate  to  report 
the problem to either:

 1) Through the INTERNET:

        My INTERNET address is:   Jean.Labrosse@Micrium.com

 2) By writing to me at:

        Micrium, Inc.
        949 Crestview Circle
        Weston, FL 33327
        U.S.A.

        c/o: Jean J. Labrosse

 3) By calling Micrium, Inc.:

        (954) 217-2036
        (954) 217-2037, FAX

    Make sure that the problem you are  reporting is in  uC/OS-II and not your
application.    If you in fact discover a bug in uC/OS-II, call the  publisher 
and see if they are shipping the same version of the code that you are using.

    If you are  using  an  older  version,  you should  first  get the lastest
version.  Most likely,  the  bug  has been found by someone else  and has been  
corrected.

****************************** SOFTWARE UPGRADES *****************************
******************************************************************************

    As you can see, I have been trying to support uC/OS (i.e. V1.xx) and  now,
uC/OS-II.  When bugs are found, I do my best to promptly correct them.   It is 
virtually  impossible  to notify  everybody that  purchased the code (i.e. the 
diskette)  to  tell  them  that  a  new  version  is  available.    You should 
occasionally check the uC/OS-II WEB site (www.ucos-ii.com) or the  Micrium web
site (www.Micrium.com) to see what version is currently shipping.

    I will not be  upgrading the  publisher  everytime  I add new  features to
uC/OS-II.

    I  would  highly  suggest that you resist changing the  STYLE  of the code
unless you don't mind spending many hours doing so everytime you upgrade.
